The presented project is a prototype for a WebShop which can be used by Tricentis employee and users to enroll courses and track their certifications in one place. It provides a basic functionality for Academy Admins to create new Courses and user to enroll and complete new certifications.
Below given is the structure for the WebShop:
A Training User logs into the Tricentis Protal to enroll a  course. (A Payment Gateway integration would be included to process the payments for paid courses.)
When the user orders a course, a request is created for him/her. Simultaneously, an enrollment record is created for him with the course details and status. The user can click on the Start button to start the Course. (This would open the actual course content in a different website where the course is hosted. This would be an integration to that website that would provide the course status and its results, if any. The integration is not setup due to time constraints.)
Once the user finishes the course he can click on Finish button. This will set the state of the enrollment to complete. It will also generate a Certificate record. The user can see his certificates in the My Certificates module.
