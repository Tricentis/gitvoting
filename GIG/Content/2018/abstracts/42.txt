This project is an interactive installation guide that gives users easy to follow step by step guides using the Tricentis manual. The goal is to break down the guide into easier to digest chunks. These can be created dynamically based on a form filled out by the user at the start. The guide will take the user through small easy to follow steps. If the user is stuck they can create a ticket which will include the steps they have completed and the step they are stuck on. If KB articles are available for a particular step the user can click the button to view these steps. We will be able to track statistics on successful and failed installations to help us make this easier for future users to install or follow an installation guide.
